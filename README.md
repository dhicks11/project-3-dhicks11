# COMP 163: Project 3 - Quest Chronicles

**AI Usage: Free Use (with explanation requirement)**

## Overview

Build a complete modular RPG adventure game demonstrating mastery of **exceptions and modules**.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Accept Assignment
1. Click the assignment link provided in Blackboard
2. Accept the assignment - this creates your personal repository
3. Clone your repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [your-personal-repo-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

### Step 2: Understand the Project Structure

Your repository contains:

```

└── README.md                   # This file
```

### Step 3: Development Workflow

```bash
# Work on one module at a time
# Test your code frequently

# Commit and push to see test results
git add .
git commit -m "Implement character_manager module"
git push origin main

# Check GitHub for test results (green checkmarks = passed!, red xs = at least 1 failed test case. Click the checkmark or x and then "Details" to see what test cases passed/failed)
```

## Core Requirements (60 Points)

### Critical Constraint
You may **only** use concepts covered through the **Exceptions and Modules** chapters. 

### 🎨 Creativity and Customization

This project encourages creativity! Here's what you can customize:

**✅ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE:**
- **Character stats** - Adjust health, strength, magic for balance
- **Enemy stats** - Make enemies easier or harder
- **Special abilities** - Design unique abilities for each class
- **Additional enemies** - Add your own enemy types beyond the required three
- **Game mechanics** - Add status effects, combos, critical hits, etc.
- **Quest rewards** - Adjust XP and gold amounts
- **Item effects** - Create unique items with creative effects

**⚠️ REQUIRED (for testing):**
- **4 Character classes:** Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric (names must match exactly)
- **3 Enemy types:** "goblin", "orc", "dragon" (must exist, stats flexible)
- **All module functions** - Must have the specified function signatures
- **Exception handling** - Must raise appropriate exceptions

**💡 CREATIVITY TIPS:**
1. Start with required features working
2. Add creative elements incrementally
3. Test after each addition
4. Be ready to explain your design choices in the interview
5. Bonus interview points for thoughtful, balanced customization!

**Example Creative Additions:**
- Vampire enemy that heals when attacking
- Warrior "Last Stand" ability that activates when health is low
- Poison status effect that deals damage over time
- Critical hit system based on character stats
- Rare "legendary" weapons with special effects

### Module 1: custom_exceptions.py (PROVIDED - 0 points to implement)

**This module is provided complete.** It defines all custom exceptions you'll use throughout the project.

### Module 2: game_data.py (10 points)

### Module 3: character_manager.py (15 points)

### Module 4: inventory_system.py (10 points)

### Module 5: quest_handler.py (10 points)

### Module 6: combat_system.py (10 points)

### Module 7: main.py (5 points)

## Automated Testing & Validation (60 Points)

## Interview Component (40 Points)

**Creativity Bonus** (up to 5 extra points on interview):
- Added 2+ custom enemy types beyond required three
- Designed unique and balanced special abilities
- Implemented creative game mechanics (status effects, advanced combat, etc.)
- Thoughtful stat balancing with clear reasoning

**Note:** Creativity is encouraged, but functionality comes first! A working game with required features scores higher than a broken game with lots of extras.

### Update README.md

Document your project with:

1. **Module Architecture:** Explain your module organization
2. **Exception Strategy:** Describe when/why you raise specific exceptions
3. **Design Choices:** Justify major decisions
4. **AI Usage:** Detail what AI assistance you used
5. **How to Play:** Instructions for running the game

### What to Submit:

1. **GitHub Repository:** Your completed multi-module project
2. **Interview:** Complete 10-minute explanation session
3. **README:** Updated documentation

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Test Integrity**


Quest Chronicles: A Modular Text-Based RPG

 Daylen Hicks

Welcome to Quest Chronicles, a dynamic, text-based RPG written in Python. This game demonstrates a clean, modular design where different game systems are built as independent modules.

AI Usage: An AI assistant was used to help explain and break down the logic, discuss the overall approach, and fix syntactical errors.

Features

Character Creation: Choose from four unique classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric).

Leveling System: Gain XP from combat to level up and grow stronger.

Persistent Saving: Automatic saving after every action. Load your game anytime.

Full Inventory & Shop: Buy, sell, use, and equip items.

Quest System: Accept, track, and complete quests with prerequisites.

Turn-Based Combat: Fight enemies in simple, turn-based battles.

Modular Data: Game content (items, quests) is loaded from .txt files for easy editing.

How to Play

Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project's root folder (the one containing main.py).

Run the following command to start the game:

python main.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to start a new game or load a save.

Module Breakdown

This project is built using modularity, meaning each major game system is in its own file:

main.py: The "brain" of the game. Runs the main loop and coordinates other modules.

character_manager.py: Handles character creation, stats, leveling, and save/load.

inventory_system.py: Manages inventory, item use, and equipment.

quest_handler.py: Manages all quest logic (accepting, tracking, completing).

combat_system.py: Handles all logic for turn-based battles.

game_data.py: Loads item and quest data from .txt files.

custom_exceptions.py: Defines custom errors (e.g., InventoryFullError) for clean error handling.

Test files are provided for your learning but are protected. Modifying test files constitutes academic dishonesty and will result in:

- Automatic zero on the project
- Academic integrity investigation

You can view tests to understand requirements, but any modifications will be automatically detected.
